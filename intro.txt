Welcome to ProDraw!

ProDraw is a handy tool used to generate 2D SVG diagram to represent sequence information. You can input your sequence in 3 ways:
UniProt Identifier (e.g. P09488)
UniProt GFF URL (see http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/dbfetch/dbfetch/uniprotkb for more information)
Upload from your local directory (gff file)

ProDraw is compatible with sequence ontology term. Different type of sequence or site can be displayed in the diagram including: polypeptide domain, polypeptide region, secondary structure, variant site, binding site, and special residues. 

Except interpreting the input files, ProDraw also allows you to customize your own diagram by adding sites or regions for your own purpose. Both the SVG diagram and the gff file can be exported after editing. 

ProDraw is still in test, so welcome to report any inconvenience or error to jx7dg@virginia.edu.
